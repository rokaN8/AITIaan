# AI Workshop Reflections

*A comprehensive reflection template for AI development workshop experiences*

---

## 1. Enjoyment and Overall Experience

### Overall Satisfaction
- **Rating (1-10):** 12
- **Would you recommend this workshop to colleagues?** 100%
- **Most enjoyable aspect:** Being able to do something fun and break away from normal work for a bit. Seeing what all the hype is about and getting exposure.
- **Least enjoyable aspect:** The unknowns - scary to see what was done in such a short time with no real idea what happens behind the scenes.

### Highlights and Memorable Moments
- **Breakthrough moments:** 
  - Realizing that the planning mode can be continued and tweaked along the way. Not just a one shot done and final have to accept what Cline decided was the best approach but could actually guide it towards the goal or what I wanted.
  - Most satisfying achievement during the workshop was the ease at which I could create a game without much knowledge about web technologies.
- **Surprising discoveries:** 
  - What exceeded your expectations? The ease at which I could really just "vibe" code the solution. Had less bugs or any real need to go back to have it redo the solution and was almost purely going forward the whole time and adding feature after feature.
  - Unexpected capabilities or limitations discovered were not really surprising, but something like sound effects has a lot of nuances. The quickest way to get around this was still to use something done by a human or would require way more effort and time that we had available.
- **Emotional journey:** 
  - Initial feelings vs. final feelings is a mixed bag. Was/am very apprehensive about doing or adopting any AI tools as my enjoyment is in the struggle and mental fatigue after a days work. I take some pride in making something work that uses my own brainpower, knowledge, and experience to get to a final solution and hard to delegate that to someone/something else.
  - Moments of frustration or excitement was more on the excitement level. Other than quickly identifying that music would not really work in the short amount of time, I was pleasantly surprised with how the final product turned out and WAY above what I thought would be able to achieve in this timeframe.

## 2. Time Management

### Time Allocation Analysis
- **Total workshop duration:** 1 day
- **Most time-consuming activities:** 
  - Waiting for the AI to do the work. Some small features took as long as the larger ones and hard to judge when or how long things would take. Hardly ever more than 10min but some deadtime between. Reminds me of the xkcd comic https://xkcd.com/303/ with the deadtime now between tasks.
  - The benefit of this deadtime is that during it could be doing creative/design decisions and coming up with more features.
  - Hardly ever needed to do any debugging or testing, did end up adding some developer features into the codebase
  - Some of my time also just spent playing the game, was fun!!!

### Iteration Cycles
- **Number of major iterations:** multiple
- **Time per iteration:** 30min-1h between features
- **Most effective working rhythm:** Plan, read over the idea, act, test

## 3. Challenges and Complexities

### Technical Challenges
- **Steepest learning curves:** - Reviewing the code in the end, I've got no idea if the quality is good or not
- **Most difficult concepts to grasp:** - How Cline decides to implement things and decides on the best way. Given LLMs are picking the best next probability of an implementation, having the internet full of less than ideal source/training could result in bad practices. 
- **Technical roadblocks encountered:** - None, not sure of the costs but had 0 issues

## 4. Creativity

### Creative Process
- **Sources of inspiration:** - Wednesday TV Show started yesterday
- **Most innovative solutions:** - None, inspired by old games and special features seen in them. 

### AI-Human Creative Collaboration
- **How did AI enhance your creativity?** - Could ask it to be a game dev/end user and found additional features to implement 
- **Where did you lead the creative direction?** - Overall theme and to stick to what I thought could be done in the timeframe that was simple and would work
- **Unexpected creative outcomes:** - AI assisted helper, would not have thought to help the user and purely skill based game.

### Design Evolution
- **How did your initial vision change?** - As I started implementing creativity started coming together. Tried to keep a general theme and had 1 feature I really wanted and built around that.
- **Key design pivots and why:** - No design pivots other than using mp3 from a free download instead of trying to get Cline to generate spooky sound effects. Still kept in some sounds but they are the worst parts of the game in my opinion.

## 5. Summary

### Key Takeaways
- **Top 3 learnings:** 
  1. AI has come a long way. Have been using ChatGPT and Copilot for limited features in functions and smaller scope, but this was way above what I thought.
  2. Can quickly run out of time trying things. Get sucked into the vibe coding and lose control of what's happening.
  3. Future looks bright but scary.

### Skills Development
- **New technical skills acquired:** - Exposure to AI
- **Improved existing skills:** - Will go back through the source when I have time to actually see what was done today. 
- **Confidence changes:** - Outlook is bright, still need to play around more but feel like the understanding of the memory banks, and how to guide Cline/AI and limit it is very handy.

### Future Applications
- **How will you apply these learnings?** - More research and playing around now that I have the fundamentals. 
- **Immediate next steps:** - LMS Module
- **Long-term goals influenced by this experience:** - Become familiar with the tools to enhance the next stage of my career.
