## Known Issues
**No known issues** - All identified problems have been resolved:
- ✅ AI assistance triggers appropriately based on player performance
- ✅ Collision detection works accurately with both normal and assisted modes
- ✅ Power-ups spawn and function correctly with visual timers
- ✅ Particle effects and screen shake work without performance impact
- ✅ Game state transitions work smoothly
- ✅ Ball size provides optimal visibility and gameplay balance

## Evolution of Decisions

### Initial Design Decisions
- **Single file constraint**: Maintained throughout for maximum portability
- **Rule-based AI**: Chosen over machine learning for predictability and no dependencies
- **Canvas rendering**: Selected for performance and visual effect capabilities
- **Zero dependencies**: Enforced to ensure offline functionality and simplicity

### Key Implementation Decisions
- **AI assistance levels**: 3-tier system (none/subtle/active) based on performance thresholds
- **Performance metrics**: Track accuracy, consecutive deaths, and time per level
- **Visual theme**: Dark cyberpunk aesthetic with neon glowing effects
- **Power-up types**: Started with 2 essential types (Wide Paddle, Slow Ball)
- **Particle system**: Object pooling for efficient memory management

### Recent Refinements
- **Ball size optimization**: Increased from 8 to 12 pixels for better visibility
- **AI assistance tuning**: Balanced to help without being obvious
- **Visual effects polish**: Screen shake and particle timing optimized
- **Performance optimization**: Maintained 60fps across all features
