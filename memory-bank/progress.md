## Evolution of Decisions

### Initial Design Decisions
- **Single file constraint**: Maintained throughout for maximum portability
- **Rule-based AI**: Chosen over machine learning for predictability and no dependencies
- **Canvas rendering**: Selected for performance and visual effect capabilities
- **Zero dependencies**: Enforced to ensure offline functionality and simplicity

### Key Implementation Decisions
- **AI assistance levels**: 3-tier system (none/subtle/active) based on performance thresholds
- **Performance metrics**: Track accuracy, consecutive deaths, and time per level
- **Visual theme**: Dark cyberpunk aesthetic with neon glowing effects
- **Power-up types**: Started with 2 essential types (Wide Paddle, Slow Ball)
- **Particle system**: Object pooling for efficient memory management

### Recent Refinements (v1.1.0)
- **Dark spooky theme**: Complete visual transformation to white/black/red aesthetic
- **Moving starry background**: Added 75 twinkling stars with smooth horizontal animation
- **Ball size optimization**: Reduced from 12 to 8 pixels for better proportions with new theme
- **Layout optimization**: Reduced brick columns from 10 to 9 for perfect canvas fit
- **Gothic brick design**: Implemented spooky gradient progression for atmospheric gameplay
- **Red glowing effects**: Updated all visual elements to match spooky theme
- **AI assistance tuning**: Balanced to help without being obvious
- **Visual effects polish**: Screen shake and particle timing optimized with red theme
- **Performance optimization**: Maintained 60fps with new star system and visual effects
