# Memory Bank

This directory contains Cline's Memory Bank - a structured documentation system that enables continuity across sessions.

## File Structure

### Core Files (Required)
1. **`projectbrief.md`** - Foundation document that shapes all other files
2. **`productContext.md`** - Why this project exists and how it should work
3. **`systemPatterns.md`** - System architecture and design patterns
4. **`techContext.md`** - Technologies, tools, and technical constraints
5. **`activeContext.md`** - Current work focus and immediate context
6. **`progress.md`** - What works, what's left, and project evolution

### File Hierarchy
