# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Spooky Breakout v1.7.0 completed** - Explosion powerup feature successfully implemented with doubled radius, enhanced UI layout, and comprehensive documentation updates. All version files updated and ready for Git commit.

## Recent Changes
- **Explosion powerup feature**: "B" key triggers ball explosion with 180-pixel radius (doubled from 90px)
- **Strategic gameplay mechanic**: Explosion costs a life but can complete levels on 0 lives if last bricks destroyed
- **Enhanced visual effects**: 25 explosion particles with red/orange colors and intense screen shake (8 intensity, 400ms)
- **Sound integration**: Explosion sound from `assets/audio/explosion.mp3` integrated with existing sound system
- **UI reorganization**: Instructions moved from below game to leaderboard sidebar in clean bullet-point format
- **Life cost warning**: Clear warning added: "Press B to explode ball (costs a life!)"
- **Smart game logic**: Level completion check occurs before life loss to prevent unfair game over
- **Version updates**: All files updated to v1.7.0 (VERSION.md, index.html, CHANGELOG.md)
- **Documentation updates**: Comprehensive changelog entry and version history updates

## Next Steps
**Project enhanced with atmospheric audio** - Sound system successfully integrated. Game ready for continued development:

**Established Workflow:**
1. `git add .` - Stage changes
2. `git commit -m "message"` - Commit with descriptive message
3. `git push` - Push to GitHub (upstream tracking configured)

**Potential future enhancements:**
- Touch controls for mobile devices
- Additional power-up types (Multi-ball, Laser Paddle)
- Sound effects and background music
- More brick types or special bricks
- Leaderboard system with localStorage

## Active Decisions
- **Ball size**: Reduced to 8 pixels for better proportions with new theme
- **Theme choice**: Dark spooky theme with white/black/red colors creates atmospheric gameplay
- **Star system**: 75 stars provide optimal visual depth without performance impact
- **Brick layout**: 9 columns ensure perfect fit within canvas boundaries
- **AI assistance**: Working perfectly - subtle help for struggling players, no interference for skilled players
- **Visual effects**: Particle explosions, screen shake, and red glowing effects enhance spooky atmosphere
- **Performance**: Maintaining smooth 60fps with new star system and visual effects

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Single file architecture**: Maintains portability and zero-dependency requirement
- **Rule-based AI**: Predictable, debuggable assistance system without external services
- **Canvas rendering**: Efficient 2D graphics with proper state management
- **Event-driven input**: Clean separation of mouse and keyboard controls
- **Object pooling**: Efficient memory management for particles and effects

## Current Learnings
- **AI assistance effectiveness**: Subtle physics tweaks and expanded collision detection provide meaningful help without being obvious
- **Visual feedback importance**: Screen shake and particle effects significantly enhance player satisfaction
- **Performance optimization**: RequestAnimationFrame with proper state management achieves smooth 60fps
- **Accessibility considerations**: Larger ball size greatly improves playability for all skill levels

## Blockers & Challenges
**No current blockers** - All technical challenges have been resolved:
- ✅ AI assistance system working as intended
- ✅ Performance optimized for smooth gameplay
- ✅ Visual effects implemented without performance impact
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility achieved
- ✅ Single file constraint maintained throughout

## Context Notes

- **AI metrics**: Tracking accuracy, consecutive deaths, and time per level for assistance decisions
- **Visual theme**: Dark spooky aesthetic with white/black/red color scheme and moving stars
- **Controls**: Both arrow keys and mouse control working smoothly
- **File size**: Approximately 67KB for complete game with all features
- **Repository**: https://github.com/rokaN8/AITIaan.git (main branch)
- **Version control**: Git tracking established with comprehensive commit history
- **Current version**: v1.7.0 with explosion powerup feature and enhanced UI
- **Deployment status**: Ready for Git commit and continued development
