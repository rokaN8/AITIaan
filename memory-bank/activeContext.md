# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Hybrid audio system and spooky visual effects completed** - Adaptive Breakout game now features a comprehensive atmospheric experience combining external audio files with programmatic sound effects, plus a dramatic spooky face image for game over. Multi-file architecture established with asset management. Project ready for version 1.3.0.

## Recent Changes
- **Hybrid audio system**: Combined external MP3 files with Web Audio API programmatic sounds
- **Background ambient music**: Added `assets/audio/background.mp3` with looping atmospheric music (volume 0.3)
- **Dramatic end game sound**: Added `assets/audio/endgame.mp3` for frightening game over effect (volume 0.7)
- **Spooky game over image**: Integrated `assets/sprites/face.png` that replaces entire canvas on game over
- **Image preloading system**: Proper image loading with error handling and state management
- **Multi-file architecture**: Transitioned from single-file to asset-based distribution
- **Audio timing coordination**: Background music starts on ball launch, stops on game over with end sound
- **Visual shock effect**: Game over popup overlays on top of full-canvas spooky face image
- **Preserved sound effects**: Maintained all existing programmatic sounds (brick hit, break, life lost)
- **Enhanced user experience**: Complete sensory horror experience with audio and visual elements

## Next Steps
**Project enhanced with atmospheric audio** - Sound system successfully integrated. Game ready for continued development:

**Established Workflow:**
1. `git add .` - Stage changes
2. `git commit -m "message"` - Commit with descriptive message
3. `git push` - Push to GitHub (upstream tracking configured)

**Potential future enhancements:**
- Touch controls for mobile devices
- Additional power-up types (Multi-ball, Laser Paddle)
- Sound effects and background music
- More brick types or special bricks
- Leaderboard system with localStorage

## Active Decisions
- **Ball size**: Reduced to 8 pixels for better proportions with new theme
- **Theme choice**: Dark spooky theme with white/black/red colors creates atmospheric gameplay
- **Star system**: 75 stars provide optimal visual depth without performance impact
- **Brick layout**: 9 columns ensure perfect fit within canvas boundaries
- **AI assistance**: Working perfectly - subtle help for struggling players, no interference for skilled players
- **Visual effects**: Particle explosions, screen shake, and red glowing effects enhance spooky atmosphere
- **Performance**: Maintaining smooth 60fps with new star system and visual effects

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Single file architecture**: Maintains portability and zero-dependency requirement
- **Rule-based AI**: Predictable, debuggable assistance system without external services
- **Canvas rendering**: Efficient 2D graphics with proper state management
- **Event-driven input**: Clean separation of mouse and keyboard controls
- **Object pooling**: Efficient memory management for particles and effects

## Current Learnings
- **AI assistance effectiveness**: Subtle physics tweaks and expanded collision detection provide meaningful help without being obvious
- **Visual feedback importance**: Screen shake and particle effects significantly enhance player satisfaction
- **Performance optimization**: RequestAnimationFrame with proper state management achieves smooth 60fps
- **Accessibility considerations**: Larger ball size greatly improves playability for all skill levels

## Blockers & Challenges
**No current blockers** - All technical challenges have been resolved:
- ✅ AI assistance system working as intended
- ✅ Performance optimized for smooth gameplay
- ✅ Visual effects implemented without performance impact
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility achieved
- ✅ Single file constraint maintained throughout

## Context Notes
- **Game state**: Fully functional with waiting/playing/gameOver states
- **Power-up system**: Wide Paddle and Slow Ball working with red-themed visual timers
- **Brick system**: 4 types (white, light gray, dark gray, blood red) with spooky gradient design
- **Star system**: 75 twinkling stars with horizontal movement and wrapping animation
- **AI metrics**: Tracking accuracy, consecutive deaths, and time per level for assistance decisions
- **Visual theme**: Dark spooky aesthetic with white/black/red color scheme and moving stars
- **Controls**: Both arrow keys and mouse control working smoothly
- **File size**: Approximately 67KB for complete game with all features
- **Repository**: https://github.com/rokaN8/AITIaan.git (main branch)
- **Version control**: Git tracking established with comprehensive commit history
- **Current version**: v1.1.0 with spooky theme implementation
- **Deployment status**: Ready for immediate distribution and further development
