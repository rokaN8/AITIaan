# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Spooky Breakout v1.8.0 completed** - Developer mode feature successfully implemented for endgame testing scenarios. Enhanced testing capabilities with isolated developer environment and comprehensive documentation updates.

## Recent Changes
- **Developer mode feature**: "D" key activates testing mode with 5 random bricks and 3 lives
- **Endgame testing capability**: Quick access to near-completion scenarios for testing explosion mechanics, AI assistance, and power-ups
- **High score protection**: Developer mode prevents score saving to maintain leaderboard integrity
- **Visual feedback**: Clear "DEVELOPER MODE - NO SCORE SAVED" warning on game over screen
- **Random brick selection**: Algorithm randomly selects 5 bricks from all possible positions for varied testing scenarios
- **State management**: Developer mode flag properly managed through game restart cycle
- **UI integration**: Developer mode instruction added to control panel ("Press D for developer mode (5 bricks, no score)")
- **Console logging**: Debug feedback confirms developer mode activation for development workflow
- **Version updates**: All files updated to v1.8.0 (VERSION.md, index.html, CHANGELOG.md)
- **Documentation updates**: Memory bank and changelog updated to reflect new testing capabilities

## Next Steps
**Project enhanced with atmospheric audio** - Sound system successfully integrated. Game ready for continued development:

**Established Workflow:**
1. `git add .` - Stage changes
2. `git commit -m "message"` - Commit with descriptive message
3. `git push` - Push to GitHub (upstream tracking configured)

**Potential future enhancements:**
- Touch controls for mobile devices
- Additional power-up types (Multi-ball, Laser Paddle)
- Sound effects and background music
- More brick types or special bricks
- Leaderboard system with localStorage

## Active Decisions
- **Ball size**: Reduced to 8 pixels for better proportions with new theme
- **Theme choice**: Dark spooky theme with white/black/red colors creates atmospheric gameplay
- **Star system**: 75 stars provide optimal visual depth without performance impact
- **Brick layout**: 9 columns ensure perfect fit within canvas boundaries
- **AI assistance**: Working perfectly - subtle help for struggling players, no interference for skilled players
- **Visual effects**: Particle explosions, screen shake, and red glowing effects enhance spooky atmosphere
- **Performance**: Maintaining smooth 60fps with new star system and visual effects

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Single file architecture**: Maintains portability and zero-dependency requirement
- **Rule-based AI**: Predictable, debuggable assistance system without external services
- **Canvas rendering**: Efficient 2D graphics with proper state management
- **Event-driven input**: Clean separation of mouse and keyboard controls
- **Object pooling**: Efficient memory management for particles and effects

## Current Learnings
- **AI assistance effectiveness**: Subtle physics tweaks and expanded collision detection provide meaningful help without being obvious
- **Visual feedback importance**: Screen shake and particle effects significantly enhance player satisfaction
- **Performance optimization**: RequestAnimationFrame with proper state management achieves smooth 60fps
- **Accessibility considerations**: Larger ball size greatly improves playability for all skill levels

## Blockers & Challenges
**No current blockers** - All technical challenges have been resolved:
- ✅ AI assistance system working as intended
- ✅ Performance optimized for smooth gameplay
- ✅ Visual effects implemented without performance impact
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility achieved
- ✅ Single file constraint maintained throughout

## Context Notes

- **Brick system**: 4 types (white, light gray, dark gray, blood red) with spooky gradient design
- **Star system**: 75 twinkling stars with horizontal movement and wrapping animation
- **AI metrics**: Tracking accuracy, consecutive deaths, and time per level for assistance decisions
- **Visual theme**: Dark spooky aesthetic with white/black/red color scheme and moving stars
- **Controls**: Both arrow keys and mouse control working smoothly
- **File size**: Approximately 67KB for complete game with all features
- **Repository**: https://github.com/rokaN8/AITIaan.git (main branch)
- **Version control**: Git tracking established with comprehensive commit history
- **Current version**: v1.8.0 with developer mode testing feature and enhanced UI
- **Deployment status**: Ready for Git commit and continued development
