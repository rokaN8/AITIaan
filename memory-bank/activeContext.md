# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Spooky Breakout v1.12.0 completed** - Enhanced floating ghost system successfully implemented as the final atmospheric feature. Game now features dramatically improved ghostly presence with larger, more numerous floating ghosts across the entire webpage.

## Recent Changes
- **Visual styling improvements**: Enhanced paddle and ball appearance for better visual appeal
- **Paddle redesign**: Changed from white paddle with red glow to black paddle with clean white border
- **Ball redesign**: Changed from solid white ball to hollow ball with white border and transparent center
- **Enhanced floating ghost system**: Dramatically improved ghostly atmosphere with larger, more numerous floating ghosts
- **Ghost size enhancement**: Doubled ghost size from 40-70 pixels to 80-140 pixels for much greater visibility
- **Ghost population increase**: Increased maximum ghost count from 4 to 8 for enhanced atmospheric presence
- **Full webpage coverage**: Ghosts now float across entire browser window, not just game canvas area
- **Directional rotation**: Ghost sprites rotate to face their movement direction for realistic floating behavior
- **Smart opacity system**: Ghosts become transparent when passing over game area to avoid obscuring gameplay
- **Ghost audio integration**: Random ghost sounds every 25+ seconds at half background music volume
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient DOM-based rendering with proper cleanup for up to 8 simultaneous ghosts
- **Atmospheric background integration**: Added spooky forest background from deepai.org with proper attribution
- **Ball speed accessibility**: Reduced initial ball speed by 20% (from 5 to 4 units) for improved player comfort
- **Game scale enhancement**: Increased entire game by 10% for better readability and modern screen compatibility
- **Canvas expansion**: Upgraded from 800x600 to 880x660 pixels with proportional element scaling
- **UI improvements**: Font sizes increased (18px→20px main UI, 24px→26px canvas text)
- **Leaderboard enhancement**: Width increased from 250px to 275px for better proportions
- **Version updates**: All files updated to v1.12.0 (VERSION.md, index.html, CHANGELOG.md)
- **Documentation updates**: Memory bank and changelog updated to reflect ghost system enhancements

## Next Steps
**Project enhanced with atmospheric audio** - Sound system successfully integrated. Game ready for continued development:

**Established Workflow:**
1. `git add .` - Stage changes
2. `git commit -m "message"` - Commit with descriptive message
3. `git push` - Push to GitHub (upstream tracking configured)

**Potential future enhancements:**
- Touch controls for mobile devices
- Additional power-up types (Multi-ball, Laser Paddle)
- Sound effects and background music
- More brick types or special bricks
- Leaderboard system with localStorage

## Active Decisions
- **Ball size**: Reduced to 8 pixels for better proportions with new theme
- **Theme choice**: Dark spooky theme with white/black/red colors creates atmospheric gameplay
- **Star system**: 75 stars provide optimal visual depth without performance impact
- **Brick layout**: 9 columns ensure perfect fit within canvas boundaries
- **AI assistance**: Working perfectly - subtle help for struggling players, no interference for skilled players
- **Visual effects**: Particle explosions, screen shake, and red glowing effects enhance spooky atmosphere
- **Performance**: Maintaining smooth 60fps with new star system and visual effects

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Single file architecture**: Maintains portability and zero-dependency requirement
- **Rule-based AI**: Predictable, debuggable assistance system without external services
- **Canvas rendering**: Efficient 2D graphics with proper state management
- **Event-driven input**: Clean separation of mouse and keyboard controls
- **Object pooling**: Efficient memory management for particles and effects

## Current Learnings
- **AI assistance effectiveness**: Subtle physics tweaks and expanded collision detection provide meaningful help without being obvious
- **Visual feedback importance**: Screen shake and particle effects significantly enhance player satisfaction
- **Performance optimization**: RequestAnimationFrame with proper state management achieves smooth 60fps
- **Accessibility considerations**: Larger ball size greatly improves playability for all skill levels

## Blockers & Challenges
**No current blockers** - All technical challenges have been resolved:
- ✅ AI assistance system working as intended
- ✅ Performance optimized for smooth gameplay
- ✅ Visual effects implemented without performance impact
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility achieved
- ✅ Single file constraint maintained throughout

## Context Notes
- **Game name**: "Spooky Breakout" with ScaryFont throughout interface
- **Leaderboard system**: Top 10 high scores with localStorage persistence and reset functionality
- **UI layout**: Left-side leaderboard with power-up timers integrated below scores
- **Font integration**: Custom ScaryFont loaded from assets/font/scaryfont.ttf

- **Power-up system**: Wide Paddle and Slow Ball with timers now positioned in leaderboard area
- **Brick system**: 4 types (white, light gray, dark gray, blood red) with spooky gradient design
- **Star system**: 75 twinkling stars with horizontal movement and wrapping animation
- **AI metrics**: Tracking accuracy, consecutive deaths, and time per level for assistance decisions
- **Visual theme**: Dark spooky aesthetic with white/black/red color scheme and moving stars
- **Controls**: Both arrow keys and mouse control working smoothly
- **File size**: Approximately 67KB for complete game with all features
- **Repository**: https://github.com/rokaN8/AITIaan.git (main branch)
- **Version control**: Git tracking established with comprehensive commit history
- **Current version**: v1.12.0 with enhanced floating ghost system, doubled ghost size, and increased ghost population
- **Deployment status**: Ready for Git commit and continued development
