# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Spooky sound system implementation completed** - Adaptive Breakout game now features atmospheric sound effects that enhance the dark spooky theme. Sound system implemented with Web Audio API using programmatically generated sounds, maintaining zero-dependency architecture. Project updated to version 1.2.0.

## Recent Changes
- **Sound system implementation**: Added Web Audio API-based sound manager with programmatic sound generation
- **Spooky sound effects**: Three atmospheric sounds - dull thump (brick hit), glass shattering (brick break), high-pitch violin screech (life lost)
- **Sound controls**: Toggle button with visual feedback (ðŸ”Š/ðŸ”‡) and M key shortcut for quick muting
- **Background music removal**: Eliminated continuous drone per user preference, keeping only event-based sound effects
- **Audio context management**: Proper Web Audio API initialization with graceful fallback for unsupported browsers
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient sound synthesis without memory leaks or performance impact
- **Version update**: Bumped to v1.2.0 to reflect sound feature addition
- **Single-file maintenance**: All sounds generated programmatically, no external audio files required

## Next Steps
**Project enhanced with atmospheric audio** - Sound system successfully integrated. Game ready for continued development:

**Established Workflow:**
1. `git add .` - Stage changes
2. `git commit -m "message"` - Commit with descriptive message
3. `git push` - Push to GitHub (upstream tracking configured)

**Potential future enhancements:**
- Touch controls for mobile devices
- Additional power-up types (Multi-ball, Laser Paddle)
- Sound effects and background music
- More brick types or special bricks
- Leaderboard system with localStorage

## Active Decisions
- **Ball size**: Reduced to 8 pixels for better proportions with new theme
- **Theme choice**: Dark spooky theme with white/black/red colors creates atmospheric gameplay
- **Star system**: 75 stars provide optimal visual depth without performance impact
- **Brick layout**: 9 columns ensure perfect fit within canvas boundaries
- **AI assistance**: Working perfectly - subtle help for struggling players, no interference for skilled players
- **Visual effects**: Particle explosions, screen shake, and red glowing effects enhance spooky atmosphere
- **Performance**: Maintaining smooth 60fps with new star system and visual effects

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Single file architecture**: Maintains portability and zero-dependency requirement
- **Rule-based AI**: Predictable, debuggable assistance system without external services
- **Canvas rendering**: Efficient 2D graphics with proper state management
- **Event-driven input**: Clean separation of mouse and keyboard controls
- **Object pooling**: Efficient memory management for particles and effects

## Current Learnings
- **AI assistance effectiveness**: Subtle physics tweaks and expanded collision detection provide meaningful help without being obvious
- **Visual feedback importance**: Screen shake and particle effects significantly enhance player satisfaction
- **Performance optimization**: RequestAnimationFrame with proper state management achieves smooth 60fps
- **Accessibility considerations**: Larger ball size greatly improves playability for all skill levels

## Blockers & Challenges
**No current blockers** - All technical challenges have been resolved:
- âœ… AI assistance system working as intended
- âœ… Performance optimized for smooth gameplay
- âœ… Visual effects implemented without performance impact
- âœ… Cross-browser compatibility achieved
- âœ… Single file constraint maintained throughout

## Context Notes
- **Game state**: Fully functional with waiting/playing/gameOver states
- **Power-up system**: Wide Paddle and Slow Ball working with red-themed visual timers
- **Brick system**: 4 types (white, light gray, dark gray, blood red) with spooky gradient design
- **Star system**: 75 twinkling stars with horizontal movement and wrapping animation
- **AI metrics**: Tracking accuracy, consecutive deaths, and time per level for assistance decisions
- **Visual theme**: Dark spooky aesthetic with white/black/red color scheme and moving stars
- **Controls**: Both arrow keys and mouse control working smoothly
- **File size**: Approximately 67KB for complete game with all features
- **Repository**: https://github.com/rokaN8/AITIaan.git (main branch)
- **Version control**: Git tracking established with comprehensive commit history
- **Current version**: v1.1.0 with spooky theme implementation
- **Deployment status**: Ready for immediate distribution and further development
