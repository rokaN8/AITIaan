# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Spooky Breakout v1.9.0 completed** - Supernatural bricks and magical ball trail system successfully implemented. Enhanced gameplay with ghost and vampire bricks plus visual magic effects.

## Recent Changes
- **Ghost bricks**: Semi-transparent bricks that phase in/out every 5 seconds (3s visible, 2s invisible)
- **Vampire bricks**: Dark red/purple bricks that regenerate health every 8 seconds if damaged
- **Magical ball trail**: Continuous sparkle particles with twinkling effects in multiple colors
- **Enhanced collision system**: Ball passes through phased-out ghost bricks completely
- **Special visual effects**: Floating ghost bricks with ethereal glow, pulsing vampire bricks
- **Particle systems**: Blood drip effects for vampire regeneration, gravity-affected trail sparkles
- **Progressive difficulty**: 15% chance for special bricks from level 3+ onwards
- **Balanced scoring**: Higher points for supernatural bricks (50 for ghost, 60 for vampire)
- **Performance optimization**: Particle limits and efficient rendering maintain 60fps
- **Version updates**: All files updated to v1.9.0 (VERSION.md, index.html, CHANGELOG.md)
- **Documentation updates**: Memory bank and changelog updated to reflect supernatural features

## Next Steps
**Project enhanced with atmospheric audio** - Sound system successfully integrated. Game ready for continued development:

**Established Workflow:**
1. `git add .` - Stage changes
2. `git commit -m "message"` - Commit with descriptive message
3. `git push` - Push to GitHub (upstream tracking configured)

**Potential future enhancements:**
- Touch controls for mobile devices
- Additional power-up types (Multi-ball, Laser Paddle)
- Sound effects and background music
- More brick types or special bricks
- Leaderboard system with localStorage

## Active Decisions
- **Ball size**: Reduced to 8 pixels for better proportions with new theme
- **Theme choice**: Dark spooky theme with white/black/red colors creates atmospheric gameplay
- **Star system**: 75 stars provide optimal visual depth without performance impact
- **Brick layout**: 9 columns ensure perfect fit within canvas boundaries
- **AI assistance**: Working perfectly - subtle help for struggling players, no interference for skilled players
- **Visual effects**: Particle explosions, screen shake, and red glowing effects enhance spooky atmosphere
- **Performance**: Maintaining smooth 60fps with new star system and visual effects

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Single file architecture**: Maintains portability and zero-dependency requirement
- **Rule-based AI**: Predictable, debuggable assistance system without external services
- **Canvas rendering**: Efficient 2D graphics with proper state management
- **Event-driven input**: Clean separation of mouse and keyboard controls
- **Object pooling**: Efficient memory management for particles and effects

## Current Learnings
- **AI assistance effectiveness**: Subtle physics tweaks and expanded collision detection provide meaningful help without being obvious
- **Visual feedback importance**: Screen shake and particle effects significantly enhance player satisfaction
- **Performance optimization**: RequestAnimationFrame with proper state management achieves smooth 60fps
- **Accessibility considerations**: Larger ball size greatly improves playability for all skill levels

## Blockers & Challenges
**No current blockers** - All technical challenges have been resolved:
- ✅ AI assistance system working as intended
- ✅ Performance optimized for smooth gameplay
- ✅ Visual effects implemented without performance impact
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility achieved
- ✅ Single file constraint maintained throughout
