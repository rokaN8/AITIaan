# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Spooky Breakout v1.6.0 completed** - Game successfully transformed from "Adaptive Breakout" to "Spooky Breakout" with comprehensive leaderboard system, font integration, and UI reorganization. All features implemented and tested. Project ready for Git commit and deployment.

## Recent Changes
- **Game renamed**: "Adaptive Breakout" transformed to "Spooky Breakout" throughout entire interface
- **ScaryFont integration**: Custom font loaded from `assets/font/scaryfont.ttf` and applied to all game text
- **Leaderboard system**: Top 10 high scores with localStorage persistence and migration from old key
- **Name entry system**: 3-character maximum input with validation for high score entries
- **UI reorganization**: Power-up timers moved from above game to inside leaderboard area
- **Reset functionality**: Leaderboard reset button with confirmation dialog to clear all scores
- **Empty slot display**: Always show all 10 leaderboard positions with "---" for empty entries
- **Enhanced localStorage**: Error handling and automatic migration from "adaptiveBreakoutLeaderboard"
- **Left-side positioning**: Leaderboard positioned to left of game canvas with proper spacing
- **Version synchronization**: Updated to v1.6.0 across all files and documentation

## Next Steps
**Project enhanced with atmospheric audio** - Sound system successfully integrated. Game ready for continued development:

**Established Workflow:**
1. `git add .` - Stage changes
2. `git commit -m "message"` - Commit with descriptive message
3. `git push` - Push to GitHub (upstream tracking configured)

**Potential future enhancements:**
- Touch controls for mobile devices
- Additional power-up types (Multi-ball, Laser Paddle)
- Sound effects and background music
- More brick types or special bricks
- Leaderboard system with localStorage

## Active Decisions
- **Ball size**: Reduced to 8 pixels for better proportions with new theme
- **Theme choice**: Dark spooky theme with white/black/red colors creates atmospheric gameplay
- **Star system**: 75 stars provide optimal visual depth without performance impact
- **Brick layout**: 9 columns ensure perfect fit within canvas boundaries
- **AI assistance**: Working perfectly - subtle help for struggling players, no interference for skilled players
- **Visual effects**: Particle explosions, screen shake, and red glowing effects enhance spooky atmosphere
- **Performance**: Maintaining smooth 60fps with new star system and visual effects

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Single file architecture**: Maintains portability and zero-dependency requirement
- **Rule-based AI**: Predictable, debuggable assistance system without external services
- **Canvas rendering**: Efficient 2D graphics with proper state management
- **Event-driven input**: Clean separation of mouse and keyboard controls
- **Object pooling**: Efficient memory management for particles and effects

## Current Learnings
- **AI assistance effectiveness**: Subtle physics tweaks and expanded collision detection provide meaningful help without being obvious
- **Visual feedback importance**: Screen shake and particle effects significantly enhance player satisfaction
- **Performance optimization**: RequestAnimationFrame with proper state management achieves smooth 60fps
- **Accessibility considerations**: Larger ball size greatly improves playability for all skill levels

## Blockers & Challenges
**No current blockers** - All technical challenges have been resolved:
- ✅ AI assistance system working as intended
- ✅ Performance optimized for smooth gameplay
- ✅ Visual effects implemented without performance impact
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility achieved
- ✅ Single file constraint maintained throughout
