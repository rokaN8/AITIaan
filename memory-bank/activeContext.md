# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Spooky Breakout v1.15.0 completed** - Major modularization and bug fixes completed. Game successfully split into modular subsystems with all visual elements restored and developer mode functionality enhanced.

## Recent Changes
### **Phase 1: Modularization (v1.15.0)**
- **CSS extraction**: Moved all styles from index.html to assets/css/styles.css
- **JavaScript modularization**: Split monolithic game into 7 specialized subsystems:
  - `gameLogic.js` - Core game loop and state management
  - `soundManager.js` - Audio system with background music and sound effects
  - `aiSystem.js` - Intelligent player assistance and metrics tracking
  - `visualEffects.js` - Particles, screen shake, stars, and image rendering
  - `physics.js` - Ball/paddle physics and collision detection
  - `brickSystem.js` - Brick creation, special behaviors, and level generation
  - `powerUpSystem.js` - Power-up spawning, effects, and management

### **Phase 2: Bug Fixes (v1.15.0)**
- **Missing images restored**: Fixed background image, game over face, and floating ghost sprites
- **Ball/paddle styling fixed**: Restored hollow balls with glow effects and black paddle with white borders
- **Paddle movement during reset**: Players can now position paddle while ball is waiting to launch
- **Auto-restart after high score**: Game automatically resets to level 1 after score submission
- **Developer mode restoration**: Full developer mode functionality restored with enhanced features

### **Phase 3: Developer Mode Enhancement (v1.15.0)**
- **'D' key activation**: Toggle developer mode with visual indicator and console feedback
- **Lives control (+/-)**: Adjust lives between 1-10 with real-time UI updates
- **Level control ([/])**: Adjust level difficulty between 1-99 with automatic level recreation
- **Enhanced developer experience**: Visual "DEV MODE" indicator with control hints on canvas
- **5 random bricks**: Developer mode creates minimal brick layout for quick testing

## Next Steps
**Project enhanced with atmospheric audio** - Sound system successfully integrated. Game ready for continued development:

**Established Workflow:**
1. `git add .` - Stage changes
2. `git commit -m "message"` - Commit with descriptive message
3. `git push` - Push to GitHub (upstream tracking configured)

**Potential future enhancements:**
- Touch controls for mobile devices
- Additional power-up types (Multi-ball, Laser Paddle)
- Sound effects and background music
- More brick types or special bricks
- Leaderboard system with localStorage

## Active Decisions
- **Ball size**: Reduced to 8 pixels for better proportions with new theme
- **Theme choice**: Dark spooky theme with white/black/red colors creates atmospheric gameplay
- **Star system**: 75 stars provide optimal visual depth without performance impact
- **Brick layout**: 9 columns ensure perfect fit within canvas boundaries
- **AI assistance**: Working perfectly - subtle help for struggling players, no interference for skilled players
- **Visual effects**: Particle explosions, screen shake, and red glowing effects enhance spooky atmosphere
- **Performance**: Maintaining smooth 60fps with new star system and visual effects

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Single file architecture**: Maintains portability and zero-dependency requirement
- **Rule-based AI**: Predictable, debuggable assistance system without external services
- **Canvas rendering**: Efficient 2D graphics with proper state management
- **Event-driven input**: Clean separation of mouse and keyboard controls
- **Object pooling**: Efficient memory management for particles and effects

## Current Learnings
- **AI assistance effectiveness**: Subtle physics tweaks and expanded collision detection provide meaningful help without being obvious
- **Visual feedback importance**: Screen shake and particle effects significantly enhance player satisfaction
- **Performance optimization**: RequestAnimationFrame with proper state management achieves smooth 60fps
- **Accessibility considerations**: Larger ball size greatly improves playability for all skill levels

## Blockers & Challenges
**No current blockers** - All technical challenges have been resolved:
- ✅ AI assistance system working as intended
- ✅ Performance optimized for smooth gameplay
- ✅ Visual effects implemented without performance impact
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility achieved
- ✅ Single file constraint maintained throughout

## Context Notes
- **Game name**: "Spooky Breakout" with ScaryFont throughout interface
- **Leaderboard system**: Top 10 high scores with localStorage persistence and reset functionality
- **UI layout**: Left-side leaderboard with power-up timers integrated below scores
- **Font integration**: Custom ScaryFont loaded from assets/font/scaryfont.ttf
- **Game state**: Fully functional with waiting/playing/gameOver states and high score entry
- **Power-up system**: Wide Paddle and Slow Ball with timers now positioned in leaderboard area
- **Brick system**: 4 types (white, light gray, dark gray, blood red) with spooky gradient design
- **Star system**: 75 twinkling stars with horizontal movement and wrapping animation
- **AI metrics**: Tracking accuracy, consecutive deaths, and time per level for assistance decisions
- **Visual theme**: Dark spooky aesthetic with white/black/red color scheme and moving stars
- **Controls**: Both arrow keys and mouse control working smoothly
- **File size**: Approximately 67KB for complete game with all features
- **Repository**: https://github.com/rokaN8/AITIaan.git (main branch)
- **Version control**: Git tracking established with comprehensive commit history
- **Current version**: v1.12.0 with enhanced floating ghost system, doubled ghost size, and increased ghost population
- **Deployment status**: Ready for Git commit and continued development
