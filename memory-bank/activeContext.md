# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Project completed successfully** - Adaptive Breakout game is fully functional with all requested features implemented. Recent work included increasing ball size from 8 to 12 pixels for better visibility and accessibility.

## Recent Changes
- **Ball size enhancement**: Increased BALL_RADIUS from 8 to 12 pixels (50% larger)
- **Visual improvement**: Ball is now much more visible and easier to track during gameplay
- **Accessibility boost**: Larger ball makes game more accessible to players with visual tracking difficulties
- **Maintained proportions**: Larger ball still looks balanced with paddle and brick sizes

## Next Steps
**Project is complete** - No immediate next steps required. Game is ready for play and distribution. Potential future enhancements could include:
- Touch controls for mobile devices
- Additional power-up types (Multi-ball, Laser Paddle)
- Sound effects and background music
- More brick types or special bricks
- Leaderboard system with localStorage

## Active Decisions
- **Ball size**: 12 pixels provides optimal visibility without affecting gameplay balance
- **AI assistance**: Working perfectly - subtle help for struggling players, no interference for skilled players
- **Visual effects**: Particle explosions, screen shake, and glowing effects enhance gameplay experience
- **Performance**: Maintaining smooth 60fps across all tested browsers

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Single file architecture**: Maintains portability and zero-dependency requirement
- **Rule-based AI**: Predictable, debuggable assistance system without external services
- **Canvas rendering**: Efficient 2D graphics with proper state management
- **Event-driven input**: Clean separation of mouse and keyboard controls
- **Object pooling**: Efficient memory management for particles and effects

## Current Learnings
- **AI assistance effectiveness**: Subtle physics tweaks and expanded collision detection provide meaningful help without being obvious
- **Visual feedback importance**: Screen shake and particle effects significantly enhance player satisfaction
- **Performance optimization**: RequestAnimationFrame with proper state management achieves smooth 60fps
- **Accessibility considerations**: Larger ball size greatly improves playability for all skill levels

## Blockers & Challenges
**No current blockers** - All technical challenges have been resolved:
- ✅ AI assistance system working as intended
- ✅ Performance optimized for smooth gameplay
- ✅ Visual effects implemented without performance impact
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility achieved
- ✅ Single file constraint maintained throughout

## Context Notes
- **Game state**: Fully functional with waiting/playing/gameOver states
- **Power-up system**: Wide Paddle and Slow Ball working with visual timers
- **Brick system**: 4 types (red, orange, yellow, green) with different hit points and scores
- **AI metrics**: Tracking accuracy, consecutive deaths, and time per level for assistance decisions
- **Visual theme**: Dark cyberpunk aesthetic with neon glowing effects
- **Controls**: Both arrow keys and mouse control working smoothly
- **File size**: Approximately 67KB for complete game with all features
