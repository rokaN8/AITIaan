## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-08

### Added
- **Spooky sound system** with Web Audio API-based programmatic sound generation
- **Three atmospheric sound effects**: Dull thump (brick hit), glass shattering (brick break), high-pitch violin screech (life lost)
- **Sound toggle controls** with visual button (ðŸ”Š/ðŸ”‡) and M key shortcut for quick muting
- **Graceful audio fallback** for browsers without Web Audio API support
- **Performance-optimized audio** maintaining 60fps gameplay with sound processing

### Changed
- **Background music removed** per user preference - now features event-based sound effects only
- **Sound integration** seamlessly woven into existing game events and collision system
- **Version updated** to 1.2.0 to reflect sound system addition

### Technical Details
